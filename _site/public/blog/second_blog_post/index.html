    <h1>FIXED AND GROWTH MINDSET</h1>

    <p>You may have encountered people who seem to embrace challenges and obstacles with a sense of ease. For them, no mountain is too high to climb. And if that way of thinking is not natural to you, perhaps you’ve wondered: How can I think like that? When it comes to mindsets, there are two main types: fixed and growth. While these fluctuate for each individual depending on what area of life you’re looking at, there are certainly those who operate predominantly from a growth mindset across the board. These people believe in themselves, learn from their experiences, and understand they can always evolve.</p>
<p>The best news of all? Mindsets are malleable, so even if you’re not predisposed toward a growth mindset, you can absolutely create shifts in your life to orient you in that direction. Read on to learn more!</p>

Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset
Someone with a fixed mindset believes that things are static, or fixed. This person generally believes that their abilities are determined at birth and unlikely to change over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people with growth mindsets believe that things are more malleable and dynamic. They are convinced that through persistence and dedication, they can effect change in themselves, in their lives, and in the world around them. They are committed to personal development across the board.</p>
<p>This mindset theory was concepted by researcher Carol Dweck. After noticing changes among school-age students, she and her team became driven to find out what makes some people more successful than others and why some of us are more compelled to keep pushing forward, even in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Note: People are often made up of a mix of mindsets. For example, you might tend to have a growth mindset as it relates to work but a fixed mindset as it relates to relationships. Additionally, people can shift their mindsets—the brain is flexible in a lot of ways, and through diligent effort, you can move from a more fixed mindset to a growth one.</p>
<p>What Is a Growth Mindset?
If you believe that things are fixed and that you can’t change anything, you may wonder why it’s even worth it to try anything at all. If you develop a growth mindset, however, you will be motivated to attempt different things and evaluate your efforts to see what shifts occur as a result. In other words, you’ll stay open and curious as you move through life.</p>
<p>Growth Mindset Benefits and Qualities
Here are some of the qualities of a person with a growth mindset, as well as the benefits of trying to adopt this approach in your own life.</p>
<p>You Believe That You Can Develop into the Person You Want to Be
Because people with growth mindsets don’t think of themselves as fixed objects, they can envision themselves growing toward an ideal, self-actualized version of themselves. This can cause people to feel hopeful and optimistic about their future.</p>
<p>You’re Motivated to Learn New Things
When you have a growth mindset, you’re hungry to learn new things. If you try something and don’t succeed, you know that it’s not a personal failure, but just part of the process. Because of this, you’re more likely to put yourself in the path of new experiences and lessons to be learned.</p>
